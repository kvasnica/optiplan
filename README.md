# MOANTOOL (MPC with Obstacle Avoidance Toolbox)

## About

MOANTOOL is a Matlab-based toolbox for formulating, solving, and simulating model predictive controllers (MPC) with embedded obstacle avoidance functionality. MOANTOOL fully automates tedious mathematical and technical details and let the user concentrate on the problem formulation. It features a rich set of tools to perform closed-loop simulations with MPC controllers and to visualize the results in an appealing way.
